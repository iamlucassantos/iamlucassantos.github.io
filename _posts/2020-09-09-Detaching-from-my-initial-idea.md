My software idea was not approved. But that's okay.

In my last group meeting, we realized we need a software idea that truly requires 5 developers. My idea, even though liked by the team, is too simplistic to the size of the team. Dropping my idea was not that easy, but necessary. Also in this meeting, we decided on the software idea we are committing to develop in the next two months: A career platform - named **HYRE** - that connects companies that need immediate and temporary jobs to workers affected by the Covid-19 economic crisis.

I confess I'm not a big fan of the app aim because it does not bring enough innovation and it does not take a realistic view on an economic crisis. In the innovative side, the market target is the only uniqueness the software will bring. Apps that connect workers to employers are already out there. On the realism side, on fighting the economic crises, I think the app does not bring a solution. First, because in a crisis, the problem is not that companies can not find short-term workers. Making a tool that allows a bridge between those two does not work if companies are not in a situation to hire. Second, there are countries where workers affected by the crisis are being subsidized by the government. Those, probably would not be interested in a freelance contract that would remove their rights and give no perspective about the future.

Even though I'm not extremely content with the goal of our app, I'm happy I will be working on a more complex concept. I'm excited to experiment with creating UI on python, using the google sheet API, handling user transactions, encrypting user data, and more. This project will make me learn way more than if we were working on my idea. From this side of the story, It's actually good that my app was not accepted.
