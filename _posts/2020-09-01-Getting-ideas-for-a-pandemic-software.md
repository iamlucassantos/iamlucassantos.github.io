This week I started my minor in Computer Science. After two years, 24/7, studying about Aerospace, it's going to be nice to have six months exploring a different field. Moreover, It's also going to be amazing to study some of the topics that interested me the most during those years in university: Software Development and Data Science.

Today, I discovered the theme of our first project: **Helping people during a pandemic time**. The main requirement is that the software needs to be built in Python, but other technologies might also be used.

To get an idea of a possible software that could be helpful during a pandemic, I started wondering about things that I've been personally missing during this Covid period. I also considered what I've have heard friends and family members say about what they have been missing. Considering all, I concluded that the coffee break is probably one of the most missed moments. In the home office setup, most of us usually forget about the times to just take a break and leave work behind for a minute. To have a coffee or a meal without being in front of the computer. To chat with your friends about anything that is not "work".

With that in mind, I got an idea of a possible software: *CoffeeBreak*. The software would be built as a web application that displays a timer, which contains the period the user has set to take a break. Then, bellow the timer, the application will suggest three activities the user could do. Such activities are related to several areas, like socialization, entertainment, and movement. The image below shows an example of the types of tasks a user would get.

By completing any of the tasks, in a gamified way, the user would get points to increase the their "Level". By completing many activities from the same area, the user would be awarded an achievement badge.

In a preliminary phase of the application, all the data would be kept locally. In a future stage, the application could be hosted as a social media where the users can see the Level and Badges of their friends.

This Friday I will be presenting this concept to my group members. Later, I return with updates about the software we decided to develop.
