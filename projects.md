### <a href="https://github.com/iamlucassantos/ISA-Altitude" target="_blank">ISA Calculator</a>
In order to make the solution of aerospace related exercises easier, I created a python atmosphere calculator that generates values of density, pressure, and temperature for any altitude. The code uses the International Standard Atmosphere (ISA) as a base and presents a simple UI.

### <a href="https://github.com/iamlucassantos/AeroGame" target="_blank">AERO Game</a>
Game created for a university game's competition using Python and Pygame. This game simulates in a simplified way the construction and launch of a spacecraft. Even though my game wasnâ€™t the winner, it got an honorable mention.

This project consisted of the development of a simple game: connect 4. This project was extremely important in order to teach me ways to make the computer "think" and play against humans in different levels of difficulty. To do that, I had to master my statistics and arrays programing skills.

For this project, I create a game where the player would think of an animal and, through yes or no questions, the game would guess it. The game was built with an initial small database of animals that increases when players choose an animal that is not present on the database. This way, the game "learns" when it is played.
